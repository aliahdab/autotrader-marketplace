## Backend Development Roadmap

This section outlines the development plan for the AutoTrader Marketplace backend.

### Phase 1: User Authentication ✅

- [x] **Setup Spring Security** with JWT for authentication
- [x] **Implement Register API** (accepts user details and stores in DB)
- [x] **Implement Login API** (returns JWT on successful login)
- [x] **Role-based Access Control** (admin/user roles)
- [x] **Test Authentication APIs** with Postman or integration tests

### Phase 2: Car Listings ✅

- [x] **Create Listing API** (upload car info + image)
- [x] **Get User's Listings API** (return listings for the authenticated user)
- [x] **Get All Listings API** (return a paginated list of approved listings)
- [x] **Filter Listings API** (by price, location, brand, etc. using JPA Specifications/Criteria API)
- [x] **Car Details API** (single listing view for approved listings)
- [x] **Admin Approval** (listings require admin approval before being visible - implemented with `approved` flag)
- [x] **Image Upload** (with S3-compatible storage)
- [x] **Test Basic Operations** (for listings)
- [x] **Test Remaining CRUD Operations** (update and delete)

### Phase 2.1: Simplified Location System (Inspired by Blocket) ✅

- [x] **Location Data Model** ✅
  - Implement flat `locations` table (id, name, slug, country_code, latitude, longitude)
  - Include `display_name_ar` and `display_name_en` directly in the model for easy rendering
  - Support for URL-friendly slugs generated consistently via a `slugify()` utility
  - Add `region` field for optional grouping (e.g., "Central Syria")
  - Add `is_active` flag to enable/disable locations without deletion
  - Create indexes on `slug` and `country_code` for faster queries

- [x] **Location Data Seeding** ✅
  - Seed major cities and regions in Syria using reliable datasets
  - Include proper UTF-8 encoding for Arabic names
  - Generate search-friendly slugs for all locations

- [x] **Location API Endpoints** ✅
  - Create endpoints to fetch locations by country (GET ?country=SY)
  - Implement search functionality (GET /search?q=dam)
  - Add caching for location data (Redis or in-memory)
  - Expose endpoints for both Arabic and English location names
  - Implement admin-only endpoints for managing locations

- [x] **Integration with Listings** ✅
  - Add location_id foreign key to CarListing entity
  - Enhance filter API to support location-based searches via ?location=damascus
  - Include location details in listing responses (both Arabic and English names)
  - Update existing listings to use the new location system
  - Add location filtering to existing search/filter APIs

- [ ] **Location-based UI Components**
  - Create dropdown/autocomplete city selector in listing form
  - Add location filter to search/listings page
  - Display location name prominently on listing cards and details

### Phase 3: Infrastructure & Optimizations (Partially Complete)

- [ ] **PostgreSQL Setup** (create DB schema for users, listings, etc.)
- [ ] **Flyway for DB Migrations** (auto versioning of database schema)
- [x] **Set up Redis** (implemented caching annotations for location data)
- [x] **Add basic logging** with Lombok's @Slf4j annotation (leveraging Spring Boot's logging infrastructure)
- [x] **Configure application.properties** (database connections, security, file storage)
- [x] **Validate file uploads** (size, format - jpeg, png, webp, etc.)
- [ ] **Implement file cleanup** (mechanism to remove old/unreferenced files)

### Phase 4: APIs and Testing ✅

- [x] **REST APIs for Car Listings** (DTOs, Validation, Error Handling)
- [x] **Unit tests** with JUnit (for controllers, services, and repositories)
- [x] **Integration tests using Testcontainers** (PostgreSQL, S3/MinIO)
- [x] **Ensure test coverage for key error scenarios** (auth failures, validation errors, upload limits, etc.)
- [x] **API Documentation** (markdown-based for all endpoints)
- [x] **Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation** (for all public APIs)
- [x] **Exception handling** (implemented GlobalExceptionHandler with appropriate status codes and messages)
- [ ] **API Rate Limiting/Throttling** (optional for security)

### Phase 5: Deployment (In Progress)

- [x] **Dockerize Storage** (set up MinIO with Docker Compose)
- [ ] **Create production-grade Dockerfile for Backend**
- [ ] **Enhance docker-compose.yml for local dev** (Backend, PostgreSQL)
- [ ] **Set up CI/CD pipeline** (GitHub Actions: test, build, deploy)
- [ ] **Implement Secrets Management** (env vars for local, GitHub Secrets/Vault for prod)
- [x] **Enable Monitoring & Health Checks** (Spring Boot Actuator)
- [ ] **Deploy to a cloud platform** (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.)

### Phase 6: Listing Lifecycle Management

- [x] **Add Listing Status Flags** (isApproved)
  - Track listing status through its lifecycle.
  - Default state: `approved = false` (already implemented in CarListing model).
- [x] **Add Additional Status Flags** (isSold, isArchived)
  - Default states: `isSold = false`, `isArchived = false`.

- [ ] **Implement Auto-Expiration Logic** for listings older than 90 days
  - Automatically archive listings older than a defined period.
  - Send reminders or notifications to users about their expired listings.

- [ ] **Admin Approval & Listing Workflow**
  - Implement admin review for approving listings before they go live.
  - Admins can mark listings as sold or archived.

- [x] **API Enhancements**
  - Ensure APIs only return `isApproved = true` and `isSold = false` listings to the public.
  - Add support for updating listing status via the API.

- [ ] **Frontend Adjustments**
  - User dashboard to manage and update listing status.
  - Admin dashboard for reviewing, approving, and archiving listings.

### Phase 7: Pricing & Ad Services

- [ ] **Create Ad Package Management System** (Store, update, delete ad packages)
  - Users can select ad packages based on price, number of photos, and duration.
  - Add flexibility to adjust pricing and features easily through an admin interface.

- [ ] **Ad Services** (Optional add-ons like "Highlight Ad", "Renew Listing", "Vehicle History Reports")
  - Admins can adjust the prices for these services dynamically.

- [ ] **Discount System for Repeat Listings**
  - Allow discounts for merchants based on their advertising volume.

- [ ] **Free Listing Options** (E.g., Free for first 3 car listings)
  - Admin can set a free listing quota or adjust the pricing structure.

### Phase 8: Security Enhancements

- [ ] **Implement Refresh Token Flow** (HttpOnly cookies or secure endpoint)
  - Allow short-lived access tokens, long-lived refresh tokens.

- [ ] **Implement Audit Logging** (Log key actions like login, listing changes, admin actions)
  - Use Spring AOP or interceptors for automated capture.

- [ ] **Review & Verify Role-Based Controls**
  - Ensure all relevant APIs are consistently protected by role (`@PreAuthorize`).
